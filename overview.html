  <h1>JMsg -- the Java Message Passing Library</h1>
<p>The JMsg library enables application to send synchronous messages between processes
  over synchronous communication channels.
  </p>
<p>
 Synchronous Communication Channels (implemented by the class {@link es.upm.babel.cclib.JMsg.SynchronousChannel})
 are typed using Java Generics, i.e., it is possible
 to restrict the values that can sent over a channel, and the Java type system guarantees
 that only well-typed values can be sent and received over a channel.
 In a sense, this library implements a very simple CCS-like process algebra (due to Robin Milner),
 without  restriction and relabelling, and where internal actions cannot be included in the
 choice construct.
 </p>
 <p>
 Synchronous Communication Channels are binary, assymetric and synchronous, i.e., a communication happens
 only when there is a thread offering to send a value over a channel (ch), 
 and another thread offers to receive a value sent over the channel (ch).
 Moreover, a channel is independent of the thread that created it. That is, any thread may receive
 values over any channel, and any thread may send values over any channel.
</p>
<p>
 The library implements a select method, which returns when exactly one
 of the offers (to send or receive values) has resulted in a synchronous communication.
 Note that the argument to the select method (a list of communication offers) may concern
 offers over differently typed communication channels (see the method
 {@link es.upm.babel.cclib.JMsg.Command#select} for
details).
</p>
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>
Below we show a small self-contained example. When the main method is invoked, two additional threads
are created, which attempt to send messages (the Integers 1 and 10) 
with the thread executing the main method. However, the receiving thread accepts only values less than
10, thus ensuring that the thread sending the value 1 will synchronize with the main thread,
while the thread sending the value 10 will wait forever to synchronize:
<pre>
<code>
import es.upm.babel.cclib.JMsg.*;

public class Example {
  static class Sender implements Runnable {
    private SynchronousChannel&lt;Integer&gt; ch;
    private int value;
    public Sender(SynchronousChannel&lt;Integer&gt; ch, int value) { this.ch = ch; this.value = value; }
    public void run() { Command.send(ch,value); }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    SynchronousChannel&lt;Integer&gt; ch = new SynchronousChannel&lt;&gt;();
    
    new Thread(new Sender(ch,1)).start();
    new Thread(new Sender(ch,10)).start();

    Integer result = Command.receiveWithGuard(ch,value -&gt; value&lt;10);
    System.out.println("The value received is "+result);
  }
}
</code>
